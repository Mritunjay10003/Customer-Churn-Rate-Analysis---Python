# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis Project

## 🧠 Introduction

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges faced by subscription-based businesses. This project aims to analyze and predict customer churn by exploring patterns, understanding customer behavior, and applying machine learning techniques on telecom data.

This notebook provides an end-to-end solution—from data exploration to predictive modeling—to identify churn-prone customers and suggest business strategies to improve retention.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:

- Understand key reasons behind customer churn
- Explore and visualize data trends
- Build a predictive model to classify customers as "Churned" or "Retained"
- Offer insights that help reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction

---

## 🗃️ Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project contains information about telecom users, such as:

- Demographic details (gender, senior citizen status, etc.)
- Services subscribed (internet, phone, streaming, etc.)
- Account information (contract type, monthly charges, tenure, etc.)
- Churn status (Yes or No)

**Target Variable:** `Churn`

---

## 🧰 Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python 🐍  
- NumPy, Pandas – For data manipulation and analysis  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn – For visualization  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

A deep dive was performed into the dataset using:

- **Univariate Analysis:** Understanding distribution of categorical and numerical features
- **Bivariate Analysis:** Comparing features with the target variable `Churn`
- **Missing Value Treatment:** Checked and handled null/missing entries

### Key Visualizations:
- Pie chart showing % of churned customers
- Histograms for tenure, monthly charges, etc.
- Count plots for contract type, gender, and payment method

---



## ✅ Results & Insights

- Customers with month-to-month contracts, high monthly charges, and electronic check payment method are more likely to churn.
- Tenure has a strong negative correlation with churn—customers who stay longer are less likely to leave.
- Senior citizens and single service users (phone-only or internet-only) tend to churn more often.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Implement advanced techniques like ensemble models (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Integrate customer feedback data
- Create a dashboard using Power BI or Tableau for real-time churn tracking
